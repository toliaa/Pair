# Pair Project

This project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations with pairs of numbers, including fuzzy numbers and complex numbers.



## Overview
The project consists of three main classes:
1. `Pair`: An abstract base class representing a pair of numbers with real and imaginary parts.
2. `Fazzynumber`: A class representing fuzzy numbers, derived from the `Pair` class.
3. `Complex`: A class representing complex numbers, also derived from the `Pair` class.



## Usage
 - Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code).
 - Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
 - Run the Program.cs file to see examples of arithmetic operations with fuzzy and complex numbers.
   
## Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pair-project.git
